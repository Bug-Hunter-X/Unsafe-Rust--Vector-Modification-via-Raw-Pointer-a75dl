# Unsafe Rust: Vector Modification via Raw Pointer

This repository demonstrates a potential issue in Rust when using raw pointers to modify vector data. The `bug.rs` file shows code that directly manipulates vector elements using `as_mut_ptr()`. This approach is unsafe and can lead to undefined behavior if not handled carefully. The `bugSolution.rs` file offers a safer alternative, illustrating the correct approach to vector manipulation. 

**Understanding the Issue:**

Directly modifying a vector's data through a raw pointer bypasses Rust's memory safety guarantees.  If the pointer is invalidated (e.g., the vector is resized or goes out of scope), it can lead to crashes, data corruption, or other unpredictable results.

**Importance:**

This example is crucial for understanding the risks involved in using unsafe Rust. While unsafe code can provide performance advantages in specific situations, it demands extreme caution and careful error handling to prevent memory-related issues.
